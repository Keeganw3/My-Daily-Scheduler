# Future Features to be added 
## Results page
* This would open a new page that would tell the user what their score was and the amount of money they won.
## Animated header
* This would flash at the user to how the game show Who Wants To Be a Millionaire Logo did.
## Randomised Questions
* This would've made it so different questions are asked on each attempt. This would be limited to 3 attempts.
## Halting Progress
* The user would have to restart from the beginning when they got a question wrong. This would've made the game more difficult to play through.

# Testing
## Validator Testing
### Python Testing


## Manual Testing
I tested the media queries by manually adjusting the screen size from roughly 500-1000px to make sure the correct changes were taking place above or below each specific screen size.

For media queries 768px, 500px and below the text across the website is shrunk in order to maintain a clear structure on smaller screens and the logo was slightly adjusted. Media queries weren't needed at sizes larger than this.

## Unfixed Bugs
Questions display - The choices for each question after question 1 show up below the previous question which is off-putting. This wasn't fixed due to time and lack of resources. I tried for several hours across multiple days to get help from online tutorials, friends, mentors, Slack and student support tutors who unfortunately weren't able to give me enough help to fix this problem. The code javascript code was written 3 different times which can be seen by going through the commits and all of them ended up with problems I didn't have the knowledge to solve.

# Deployment
For all of the below steps you must head to Github.
* Log into Github
* Load up the required repository.
* Go to Settings and scroll down to Github pages (this will open up a new webpage).
* Click on the dropdown menu called "None" and then select "Master Branch".
* A second dropdown menu should appear that says "/root" and a button that says Save.
* Click Save and now the link for the website has been made.
